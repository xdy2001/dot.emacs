# My Emacs Configurations

## Structure

* `3rd` contains packages from 3rd parties', and these packages can not be found in
  emacs package repositories or the version there are too old

* `elpa` contains packages from emacs package repositories

* `personal` contains all my own configurations, they are ordered and invoked by dot.emacs

* `dot.emacs` is actually the `.emacs`

## How to

1. Create `.emacs.d` directory and put `3rd`, `elpa`, and `personal` there

2. Put `dot.emacs` to your $HOME directory and rename it to `.emacs`
